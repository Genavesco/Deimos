# Demo Outline (30-second video or 7-slide deck)

Use this script as a starting point. Adjust wording to match your team's voice and the final feature set.

## Video Script (30 seconds)
- **0:00-0:02 -- Introduction**
  - "Hi, we are Team <Name>."
- **0:02-0:05 -- Challenge & Inspiration**
  - "We tackled the asteroid impact preparedness challenge becauseâ€¦"
- **0:05-0:10 -- Project Name + Tagline**
  - "Meet DEIMOS, a planetary-defense simulator powered by NASA data."
- **0:10-0:20 -- Demo the product**
  - Screen recording: selecting an asteroid, running a simulation, showing the map overlays and key metrics.
  - Narrate the data flow: "NASA SBDB gives us real orbital parameters; OpenTopoData tailors the terrain response; World Bank population estimates exposure."
- **0:20-0:28 -- Impact & Future**
  - "Emergency managers can test mitigation strategies in seconds, and educators can visualise planetary defense scenarios."
- **0:28-0:30 -- Call to Action**
  - "With DEIMOS, NASA's open data becomes an actionable safety playbook."

Remember to burn in English subtitles even if narration is in English.
